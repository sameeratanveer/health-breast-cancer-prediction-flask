# üß¨ Breast Cancer Prediction Web App

This Flask-based web application predicts whether a tumor is **cancerous** or **not cancerous** using a pre-trained logistic regression model based on user input features.

## Overview

Breast cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer in women worldwide. Early detection significantly improves the chances of recovery. This app provides a simple interface where users can input tumor features and get an instant prediction on whether the tumor is likely **cancerous (malignant)** or **not cancerous (benign)**.

## Input Format

The application accepts comma-separated feature values in the following order:

| Feature Index | Feature Name       | Description                          |
|---------------|--------------------|--------------------------------------|
| 1             | radius_mean        | Mean of distances from center to points on the perimeter |
| 2             | texture_mean       | Standard deviation of gray-scale values |
| 3             | perimeter_mean     | Mean size of the core tumor          |
| ...           | ...                | ...                                  |
| N             | feature_n          | Additional features as used in model |

üìù **Note**: You must enter **all required features** in the same order, separated by commas.
